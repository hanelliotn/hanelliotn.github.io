I graduated from the [University of California, Davis](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/) 
(B.S. Computer Science, class of 2021), and am currently an associate software 
engineer at [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) working primarily on developer 
experience that involve Github APIs, AWS, Docker, Jenkins, Grafana and Bash scripting, 
with Python and Java as main programming languages.

I have had two years of experience, and would love to grow my skills in the field of 
data science and AI/ML.
